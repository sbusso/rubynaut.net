Web Entrepreneur, Rails developer since early versions. Programming addict since school. Full stack aware with a wide range of technical skills and business oriented. I will bring you more than just coding. I'm solution finder and implied in your projects.

I like to work on inovative project, analyse ideas and build solutions. Available as a developer, lead developer or consultant. I've been ScrumMaster for 3 years and embrace agility.

* Your business is to bring a commercial product to market,
* you think _Lean_ Startup, not Twitter or Facebook,
* small team, also Iâ€™m fine being the one developer,
* remote worker is not a problem for you,
* I do server side development using Ruby on Rails,
* and client side development using JavaScript.
