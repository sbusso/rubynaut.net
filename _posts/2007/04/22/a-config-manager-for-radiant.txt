For my training on Radiant I did a small extension to manage config parameters, usually accessible with the console or sql.

installation:

<pre>
svn co http://www.rubynaut.net/svn/radiant/extensions/config_editor/ config_editor
</pre>

Done.

I liked:

* the api to add your admin controls
* an asbtract model controller to help in managing your model's CRUD with only few lines.
* the good practises you can get from the Radiant code :)

Creating an extension with Radiant is so easy! I guess this system will become very popular, and it will give ideas to others :p. With this, Radiant become a very good base to create any kind of website.

PS: the extension has now a tag <code><r:config key="key"/></code> to access a value inside your page.
