"Ebb":http://ebb.rubyforge.org/ is new server to put in front of a rackable ruby application.

Have a look to the "Ebb website":http://ebb.rubyforge.org/ to get some comparison with other app servers.

<pre>
sudo gem install ebb
</pre>

What I needed to do before on Mac OS X (leopard with MacPorts):

<pre>
sudo port install glib2
</pre>
