For those who haven't seen yet, the new ruby-lang website is out. Working on it for long time, the members of the community did a great job with this new design and use Radiant CMS to power it.

Please find it and the latest 1.8.5 version of ruby on the website : <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/</a>
